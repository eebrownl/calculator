# calculator

In this project I will make a working calculator. 

Post-mortem:

Process: 

It took me three tries to really get the Javascript working properly on this project. On the first attempt, I overthought how I should make it all work. I ended up down a rabbit hole of object classes and never really got much working. I ended up scrapping every letter of code and starting over.

My second attempt went much better. I played a lot with adding data attributes in the Javascript and got a lot closer to making it all work. I realized in the course of this, though, that I could simplify my code a lot if I put all the keys on the calculator into their own div, so once I saw the vision for how to make the code simpler, I erased all my JS again, went into the html and added the div, then fixed up the CSS because that broke it a bit. I realize I could have just added the div using JS and it would have been quicker, but I wanted to try it all from scratch again. 

My third attempt went great. Now that I had built a couple of tries that half-worked and realized the mistakes I had made, this attempt went really quickly. I cranked the JS out in about 2 hours now that I new where I wanted to go with my code. 

What I learned:

More than anything, this project taught me a lot about data attributes and adding/changing/removing them in JS to get particular things to happen based on what state they are in. I'm not sure if there is a more elegant way to change the state of something (my gut tells me there is), but this was really fun to figure out and use 'dataset' extensively in this project.
